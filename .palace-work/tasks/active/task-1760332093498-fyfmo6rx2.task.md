# Standardize available panels area dimensions with minimum width constraints

# Standardize available panels area dimensions with minimum width constraints

The panel configurator's available panels area needs standardized dimensions to improve preview consistency.

## Current Issue
The available panels section in the PanelConfigurator doesn't have minimum width constraints, which can lead to inconsistent panel preview rendering across different screen sizes and configurations.

## Requested Changes
1. Add a minimum width constraint to the available panels area to ensure previews render consistently
2. Standardize the preview dimensions so all panel previews have a consistent size
3. Consider making the preview area responsive while maintaining minimum thresholds for usability

## Context
This request comes from the electron-app project where the PanelConfiguratorModal is being used. The modal has been updated to remove max-width constraints to allow more space, but now the available panels area needs proper dimension handling.

## Suggested Approach
- Add CSS min-width to the available panels container
- Ensure panel preview cards have consistent dimensions
- Test across different viewport sizes to ensure good UX

This will improve the overall user experience when configuring panel layouts.
